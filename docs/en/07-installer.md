# pmcp installer: CarPlay map on the AID, MU1161 / 791

Status: **tested in the car (October 2026).** Code: [`installer/`](../../installer/).
The SD build is made by `installer/build_sd.py` (the output directory holds `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` with the hash of every file;
the version shown in GEM is `pmcp-0.2.0-mu1161-791-<build id>`, where the id is the first 8 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the
manifest and the `pmcp.sh` template). The install card is assembled by `installer/build_card_install.py`, the rescue card by
`installer/build_rescue.py`.

## Packages (built together, installed in batches from M.I.B. buttons)

| Package | What it changes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Rescue card | nothing on the unit (separate card from `installer/build_rescue.py`) | tested in the car (`WYNIK=OK`) |
| A CarPlay video + `core.so` variants | `dio_manager` → wrapper, `/mnt/app/carplaymaps` | works |
| B Java mechanism + NavActiveIgnore | one fixed block in `lsd.sh` + JAR | works; unlocked by the file `pmcp/ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B` on the card |
| C iPhone map parameters in the URL | `core.so` only (variant `url-map-hybrid`, `showSpeedLimit=yes`) | in the menu; the parameter shows nothing on this unit |
| D Track title and artist | JAR `pmcp-np.jar` (`HsmTarget` + `CurrentStationInfo`) | works ([`nowplaying/`](../../nowplaying/)) |
| E Native guidance (port of Tomasz's work) | "System RG" (iAP2 driver, `iap2.cfg`, reader) + JAR `pmcp-rg.jar` | works ([`rg/`](../../rg/)) |
| F Steering-wheel zoom | JAR `pmcp-zoom.jar` (hook in `DSIKeyPanelDispatcher`, short press only) | works ([`hmiextras/`](../../hmiextras/)) |
| G Day/night for the AID map | JAR `pmcp-dn.jar` (hooks in `ASLHandler`) | works ([`hmiextras/`](../../hmiextras/)) |

**Stage A does not touch the HMI** (Java): the worst outcome is no CarPlay/AA, while GEM and "Remove everything" still work.

**Everything Java goes through one block in `lsd.sh`** (before J9 starts, nothing after it), with a trial boot:
- the block reads a single file: `/mnt/app/carplaymaps/HMI_BOOT` = `SET_ID JAR JAR …` (id = `name-8 chars of sha` joined with `+`).
  `pmcp.sh` replaces it with a single `mv`, so after a power loss the boot sees either the old or the new set, never a mix;
- a new set loads **once** as a trial (`/mnt/persist/pmcp/trial.<ID>`);
- it becomes permanent **only when "4. Confirm" (confirm) is pressed in GEM during that trial boot**. On every boot `lsd.sh` first
  deletes and then writes `/mnt/persist/pmcp/last-boot` (`set=<ID> use=trial|yes|no`); `java-confirm` requires `use=trial` for the
  current id, no `ok.<ID>` and no `DISABLED`. A stock boot after a failed trial therefore cannot confirm a broken set;
- **there is no automatic confirmation**. A running J9 process does not prove a working HMI;
- without confirmation **every following boot (e.g. a reset with the knob) is stock**; to try again: "5. Try again" (repeat
  trial boot);
- **in update mode (`RUN_MODE=swdl`) the block does nothing** (the stock `lsd.sh` starts the HMI in that mode too, with a copy of
  `jars/` in `/ramdisk`). The rescue card therefore always meets a stock HMI;
- `/mnt/persist/pmcp/DISABLED` (set by the rescue card) disables the block completely.

Coming back to the car before the unit goes to sleep is not a new boot. Only a run of `lsd.sh` counts (cold start, reset, restart
after installing). `boot.log` in `/mnt/persist/pmcp` shows what happened; "Status" in GEM also shows `last-boot`.

## What it installs

The omonob/mathsls layout on MU1161:

| Item | Source | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `altscreen-most-bridge` | mathsls MU1161 profile (= ours with the diasdio fix) | `fed7dce4…44f4` |
| `carplay-cluster-supervisor` | mathsls (fix `/ramdisk` → `/dev/null`) | `8e6ac3a8…7569` |
| `libcarplay-security-bridge.so`, `carplay-pairing-helper`, `libCarPlayPairingCore.so` | mathsls = omonob | `1cef6a39…`, `ffb7d4df…`, `90c348f9…` |
| `dio_manager.wrapper.sh` | mathsls (logs to `/dev/null`) | `8c12f697…633d` |
| `core.so` | one of 5 variants (below) | in `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` |
| `lsd.sh` (stage B+) | generated on the host from the stock file: stock + one pmcp block before `export LD_PRELOAD` / `$J9` | `LSD_JAVA` in the manifest |
| Java JARs (stage B+) | our builds (`NavActiveIgnore.jar`, `pmcp-np.jar`, `pmcp-rg.jar`, `pmcp-zoom.jar`, `pmcp-dn.jar`) | in `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` |

The current `core.so` and JAR hashes are in the manifest that `installer/build_sd.py` generates for each build.

Left out on purpose: mathsls's `libcardshim.so` (`zoomFactor` 1.5, display `properties`/`uid`). The `map-square` variant therefore
takes only mathsls's safe-area layout, not their whole configuration.

`core.so` variants (`switch` changes only this file, then restart, no "4. Confirm"), all built by `build_core.py`, all 240×144 mm.
Safe area = x / y / width / height on the 800×480 stream:

| Variant | URL | Safe area | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `map-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | Map only, VW shows guidance natively |
| `card-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | with the iPhone's manoeuvre card |
| `url-map-hybrid` | `…/map?showSpeedLimit=yes` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | speed-limit parameter (no visible effect) |
| `map-clean-l40` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 160 / 108 / 400 / 296 | shifted 40 columns to the left |
| **`map-square`** | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 240 / 60 / 320 / 340 | **default (main button), chosen after a longer drive.** mathsls's MU1161 layout, closer to square |

## Fail-closed gates (what must match before anything is written)

1. **Hashing self test** on the unit: the factory `/net/rcc/usr/bin/sha1sum`, run locally on MMX (where GEM scripts run), must
   compute the correct SHA-1 of `selftest.bin`. The manifest stays SHA-256; `build_sd.py` adds a SHA-256 → SHA-1 map (`HASHMAP`) to
   `pmcp.sh` for every manifest file and every factory file that is checked. No entry in the map means refusal.
   (SHA-256 in `gawk` was dropped: the "C" locale on QNX is multibyte, only `C-TRADITIONAL` worked, and it ran at about
   10–20 KB/s. With `sha1sum` actions take seconds.)
2. **Payload on the SD card:** hash and size of every file equal to the manifest embedded in `pmcp.sh`. The loop runs over the
   manifest inside the script itself (no temporary file), so a read-only card cannot skip the check.
3. **Firmware:** `lsd.jxe` = 55,830,309 bytes (MU1161).
4. **Unit state:**
   - `STOCK`: no `/mnt/app/carplaymaps`, no navigation/control JARs, `lsd.sh`, `dio_manager`, iAP2 driver and `iap2.cfg` stock.
     `install` is allowed only in this state. A leftover `.carplaymaps-old-*` from an interrupted `restore` does not block it
     (`install` cleans it up).
   - `VIDEO` (stage A): wrapper active, stock `lsd.sh`, none of our JARs.
   - `JAVA` (stage B+): as `VIDEO`, plus the block in `lsd.sh` and a consistent JAR set (each with its manifest hash, `HMI_BOOT`
     matching exactly).
   - `PARTIAL`: an interrupted action, stock copies intact. Only `restore` (and `rg-system-off`) is allowed.
   - `UNKNOWN`: anything else, e.g. another mod or a modified `lsd.sh`. **Everything is refused.**
5. **Every staged copy** is hashed before the swap; `chmod` is checked, `dio_manager` must be executable. Right before the swap the
   installer checks again that `lsd.sh` and `dio_manager` are still stock.
6. **After the swap** the state must be the expected one and `core.so` must have the expected hash. Otherwise automatic rollback.
7. **Flush to disk:** `sync` on MMX (`on -f mmx sync`), because the files live there; an RCC `sync` is not needed.

Swap order:
- stage A: old trial markers removed → `carplaymaps` directory → `dio_manager`;
- `java-on`: JAR → `HMI_BOOT` (new id = new trial boot) → `lsd.sh` (only for the first package);
- `java-off`: `HMI_BOOT` → JAR removed; for the last package: stock `lsd.sh` first, then JAR and `HMI_BOOT`;
- `restore`: `lsd.sh` → `dio_manager` → JARs → System RG → trial markers → `carplaymaps` moved with one `mv` to
  `.carplaymaps-old-<pid>`, and only then `rm -rf`.
- System RG (`rg-system-on`) is locked like stage B; `/mnt/system` goes back to read-only after the write.

**Power-loss test** (`installer/test/fault_inject.sh`): for every action of the chain
install → java-on nai → java-on np → rg-system-on → java-on rg → switch → java-off np → java-off rg → rg-system-off → java-off nai → restore
the script is killed before the 1st, 2nd, 3rd … command that changes the unit. For each point: a simulated **next boot** (the
`lsd.sh` block from the killed tree) must not load, without a trial, a set the user has not confirmed; the state must be
STOCK/VIDEO/JAVA/PARTIAL, and `restore` (or install+restore from STOCK) must give the stock tree.

## Use in the car: GEM buttons

Requires: M.I.B. installed ([01-mib-install-backup.md](01-mib-install-backup.md)) and an **install card** built by
`installer/build_card_install.py`: a complete card = the untouched `MIB_V3.6.0.zip` tree (autorun disarmed, `_Swdlautorun.txt`) +
the SD build from `installer/build_sd.py` (`pmcp/`, `esd/Launcher-sda0.esd`), assembled with
`python3 -I installer/build_card_install.py <SD build> <card dir>` (every build file is checked against `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt`; it
refuses an armed autorun, rescue-card files or `ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B`). Hashes of all files: `PMCP_CARD_MANIFEST.txt`, instructions:
`PMCP_INSTRUKCJA.txt`. You copy **the whole content** of the directory to an empty card (FAT32) instead of adding `pmcp/` to an
M.I.B. card by hand.

How it works: in GEM the unit has a symlink `engdefs/z_Launcher-sda0.esd` → **the menu file on the card**
(`/net/mmx/fs/sda0/esd/Launcher-sda0.esd`, created by M.I.B. at install time). The `pmcp_CarPlay_AID` screen is appended to that
file on the card. Nothing changes on the unit. The base file is exactly `esd/Launcher-sda0.esd` from `MIB_V3.6.0.zip`
(`22739f72…9121`); a test checks that the original content is untouched (only the end is appended).

1. On the computer: copy the whole content of the install card directory to an empty card (card root).
   Check the version in the header of the pmcp screen in GEM: it must match the first line of `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt`.
2. In the car: GEM → `=>M.I.B.<=` → **`pmcp_CarPlay_AID`**:
   - "0. Diagnostyka (tylko odczyt, zrob zdjecia ekranu)" (diagnostics, read-only, take photos of the screen): read-only
     diagnostics that work even when `pmcp.sh` stops at its self test;
   - "1. Check card and unit (read-only)" → `verify`;
   - "Status (read-only)";
   - "2. Install the CarPlay map on the AID" (stage A, variant map-square);
   - "Remove everything (back to factory files)";
   - main screen "3. Install all features": runs System RG on and every Java package on in one go (one set, one trial
     boot, then "4. Confirm"); stops at the first failure, "already on" counts as done;
   - submenu `pmcp_advanced` with "0. Diagnostyka" and the submenus `pmcp_inne_warianty` (install with another variant) and `pmcp_zmien_wariant` (`switch`, e.g.
     "Zmien wariant na: map-clean" (change variant to));
   - submenu `pmcp_advanced` → `pmcp_etap_B_java`: System RG wlacz/wylacz (on/off), Wlacz/Wylacz (enable/disable) a package (Confirm and Try again are on the main screen). The actions refuse until the card holds the file `pmcp/ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B` (after the rescue card test).
3. The result is on the GEM screen. The SD card is read-only in GEM (even `mount -uw` fails), so the log cannot be written to the
   card: the installer prints `PMCP_WARN=SD_LOG_NOT_WRITABLE` and carries on. **Photograph the screen.** If the card is writable,
   the log goes to `/pmcp/log/pmcp-<action>-<pid>.log`.

The labels have no Polish diacritics (it is not known whether GEM and its parser handle them).

First-time order:
1. Rescue card on a healthy unit (below) → log `WYNIK=OK` (result OK).
2. "Sprawdz…" (`verify`): read-only. Expected `PMCP_VERIFY_OK state=STOCK`.
3. "Instaluj… map-square" (stage A), then a full restart. If the AID shows no CarPlay picture: on the iPhone, Settings → General →
   CarPlay → the car → "Forget This Car", and reconnect (the iPhone remembers the car's old displays).
   For another map layout: "Zmien wariant na: …".
4. Stage B: empty file `pmcp/ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B` on the card → one package at a time: "Wlacz: …" → restart (trial boot) →
   check the HMI and the feature → **in the same boot** "4. Confirm". Without confirmation the next boot is stock.
   For package E, first "System RG: wlacz", restart, check that CarPlay connects, and only then "Wlacz: Prowadzenie" (guidance).
5. Rollback: "Remove everything (back to factory files)" and restart.

## Host tests

`installer/test/run_tests.sh SD_BUILD mksh ksh` (with `PMCP_RESCUE_SD=<rescue card>`): the unit's file tree from the backup (real
`lsd.sh`, `dio_manager`, `jars`, iAP2 driver, `iap2.cfg`; `lsd.jxe` as a file of the right size), shells `mksh` (pdksh family, like
QNX) and `ksh` (ksh93). The exit status is the number of failed checks. They cover, among other things:

- `verify` writes nothing; a wrong variant, a corrupted payload byte (also with an unwritable log directory), a corrupted self test,
  a wrong `lsd.jxe` size, a modified `lsd.sh` and a foreign mod are refused with no change to the tree;
- the full chain install → Java packages (1, 2 and 5 at once) → System RG → switch → restore gives a tree **byte-identical** to stock;
- **trial boot on the real `lsd.sh` block** combined with `pmcp.sh`: trial → unconfirmed boot is stock → "4. Confirm" refused →
  retry → a boot in `swdl` mode loads nothing and deletes `last-boot` → confirmation only during the trial boot → a confirmed set
  always loads → `DISABLED` disables and blocks confirmation;
- the patched `lsd.sh` = stock + one block (checked with `diff`);
- leftovers (`.carplaymaps-new-*`, `.carplaymaps-old-*`, `*.pmcp-*`, old `ok.*` markers) are cleaned up by `install`; an
  interrupted `restore` (directory already moved) does not block the tool;
- rescue card: a healthy unit is unchanged; a `JAVA` unit → stock `lsd.sh`, JARs removed, `DISABLED`; a unit with System RG →
  stock driver and `iap2.cfg`, `SYSTEM_ON` and `last-boot` removed; no backup copy or no `lsd.sh` → an honest `WYNIK=NIEPEWNY`
  (result uncertain);
- GEM menu: number of scripts = number of menu entries, syntax, allowed actions, main button = `map-square`, the version with build
  id identical in `pmcp.sh`, the menu and `BUILD-MANIFEST`.

`installer/test/fault_inject.sh SD_BUILD mksh`: the power-loss test (above).

What the host tests do not cover: QNX paths (`on -f mmx`, `mount`, `slay`, `/net/mmx` path translation) and the factory `sha1sum`
are skipped in test mode (the host computes SHA-1 with `shasum -a 1`); file permissions are not part of the `snapshot`; the
`Swdlautorun` → `stuff.sh` chain is tested on the script only. These parts were checked in the car.

## Rescue card (package 0)

A separate card (`installer/build_rescue.py`, instructions in `PMCP_RATUNEK_README.txt` on the card). An armed `Swdlautorun.txt` →
the unit enters update mode by itself (`RUN_MODE=swdl`; our block loads nothing then) → M.I.B. 3.6.0 `stuff.sh` → `pmcp-ratunek.sh`:
- stock `lsd.sh` from `/mnt/app/carplaymaps/rollback/`;
- our JARs removed;
- `/mnt/persist/pmcp/DISABLED`, `last-boot` removed;
- System RG: stock iAP2 driver and `iap2.cfg` from the backup copies (selected by size), `SYSTEM_ON` removed.

The video (stage A) stays; "Remove everything" in GEM cleans up the rest afterwards. On a healthy unit without pmcp the script changes
nothing and only writes the log `PMCP_RATUNEK_LOG.txt`. The M.I.B. autorun in P4512 update mode works without any HMI interaction
(checked in the car, `WYNIK=OK`).

**Unlocking stage B:** test the card on a healthy car → log `PMCP_RATUNEK_LOG.txt` with `WYNIK=OK` → empty file
`pmcp/ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B` on the install card. Without it the Java and System RG actions refuse (`STAGE_B_LOCKED_…`).

## Safeguards for starting J9 with our JARs

Classes are version 46, references are checked against the unit's `java/*` classes (RefCheck), and every call from stock code is
guarded (tools in [`buildtools/`](../../buildtools/)). The scripts use the ksh constructs of the mathsls installer (backticks,
`while read`, heredoc, `case`, `read` with redirection). Fallback if something goes wrong: the trial boot with manual confirmation,
then the rescue card. Black screen during a trial boot (before "4. Confirm"): hold the volume knob for 10 s; the next boot runs without our JARs.
