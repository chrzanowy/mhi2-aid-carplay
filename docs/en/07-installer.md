# pmcp installer: CarPlay map on the AID, MU1161 / 791

Status: **tested in the car (October 2026; v1.4 route guidance November 2026).** Code: [`installer/`](../../installer/).
The SD build is made by `installer/build_sd.py` (the output directory holds `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` with the hash of every file;
the version shown in GEM is `pmcp-0.5.0-mu1161-791-<build id>`, where the id is the first 8 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the
manifest and the `pmcp.sh` template). The install card is assembled by `installer/build_card_install.py`, the rescue card by
`installer/build_rescue.py`.

## Packages (built together, installed in batches from M.I.B. buttons)

| Package | What it changes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Rescue card | nothing on the unit (separate card from `installer/build_rescue.py`) | tested in the car (`RESULT=OK`; until v1.3 `WYNIK=OK`) |
| A CarPlay video + `core.so` variants | `dio_manager` → wrapper, `/mnt/app/carplaymaps` | works |
| B Java mechanism + NavActiveIgnore | one fixed block in `lsd.sh` + JAR | works; main-screen button "4. Install additional features" (no unlock needed since v1.2.0) |
| C iPhone map parameters in the URL | `core.so` only (variant `url-map-hybrid`, `showSpeedLimit=yes`) | in the menu; the parameter shows nothing on this unit |
| D Track title and artist | JAR `pmcp-np.jar` (`HsmTarget` + `CurrentStationInfo`) | works ([`nowplaying/`](../../nowplaying/)) |
| E Native guidance (port of Tomasz's work) | "Route guidance system" (iAP2 driver with log gate, `iap2.cfg`, reader `pmcp-r1`) + one JAR `pmcp-guidance.jar` (package `rg`: arrows, lanes, distance bar, street, ETA, maneuver fallbacks) | works ([`rg/`](../../rg/)) |
| F Steering-wheel zoom | JAR `pmcp-zoom.jar` (hook in `DSIKeyPanelDispatcher`, short press only) | works ([`hmiextras/`](../../hmiextras/)) |
| G Day/night for the AID map | JAR `pmcp-dn.jar` (hooks in `ASLHandler`) | works ([`hmiextras/`](../../hmiextras/)) |

**Stage A does not touch the HMI** (Java): the worst outcome is no CarPlay/AA, while GEM and "8. Remove everything" still work.

**Everything Java goes through one block in `lsd.sh`** (before J9 starts, nothing after it), with a trial boot:
- the block reads a single file: `/mnt/app/carplaymaps/HMI_BOOT` = `SET_ID JAR JAR …` (id = `name-8 chars of sha` joined with `+`).
  `pmcp.sh` replaces it with a single `mv`, so after a power loss the boot sees either the old or the new set, never a mix;
- a new set loads **once** as a trial (`/mnt/persist/pmcp/trial.<ID>`);
- it becomes permanent **only when "5. Confirm" (`confirm`) is pressed in GEM during that trial boot**. On every boot `lsd.sh` first
  deletes and then writes `/mnt/persist/pmcp/last-boot` (`set=<ID> use=trial|yes|no`); `confirm` (for the Java set; `java-confirm` alone does the same) requires `use=trial` for the
  current id, no `ok.<ID>` and no `DISABLED`. A stock boot after a failed trial therefore cannot confirm a broken set;
- **there is no automatic confirmation**. A running J9 process does not prove a working HMI;
- without confirmation **every following boot (e.g. a reset with the knob) is stock**; to try again: "6. Try again" (repeat
  trial boot);
- **in update mode (`RUN_MODE=swdl`) the block does nothing** (the stock `lsd.sh` starts the HMI in that mode too, with a copy of
  `jars/` in `/ramdisk`). The rescue card therefore always meets a stock HMI;
- `/mnt/persist/pmcp/DISABLED` (set by the rescue card) disables the block completely.

Coming back to the car before the unit goes to sleep is not a new boot. Only a run of `lsd.sh` counts (cold start, reset, restart
after installing). `boot.log` in `/mnt/persist/pmcp` shows what happened; "Status" in GEM also shows `last-boot`.

## What it installs

The omonob/mathsls layout on MU1161:

| Item | Source | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `altscreen-most-bridge` | mathsls MU1161 profile (= ours with the diasdio fix) | `fed7dce4…44f4` |
| `carplay-cluster-supervisor` | mathsls (fix `/ramdisk` → `/dev/null`) | `8e6ac3a8…7569` |
| `libcarplay-security-bridge.so`, `carplay-pairing-helper`, `libCarPlayPairingCore.so` | mathsls = omonob | `1cef6a39…`, `ffb7d4df…`, `90c348f9…` |
| `dio_manager.wrapper.sh` | mathsls (logs to `/dev/null`) | `8c12f697…633d` |
| `core.so` | one of 5 variants (below) | in `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` |
| `lsd.sh` (stage B+) | generated on the host from the stock file: stock + one pmcp block before `export LD_PRELOAD` / `$J9` | `LSD_JAVA` in the manifest |
| Java JARs (stage B+) | our builds (`NavActiveIgnore.jar`, `pmcp-np.jar`, `pmcp-guidance.jar` (package `rg`), `pmcp-zoom.jar`, `pmcp-dn.jar`) | in `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` |
| route guidance system | iAP2 driver `519ea3c5…` (743,272 B), `iap2.cfg` `c61407d9…`, reader `rgi-observer` `3166df9b…` (13,552 B), see [`rg/`](../../rg/) | in `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` |

The current `core.so` and JAR hashes are in the manifest that `installer/build_sd.py` generates for each build.

Left out on purpose: mathsls's `libcardshim.so` (`zoomFactor` 1.5, display `properties`/`uid`). The `map-square` variant therefore
takes only mathsls's safe-area layout, not their whole configuration.

`core.so` variants (`switch` changes only this file, then restart, no "5. Confirm"), all built by `build_core.py`, all 240×144 mm.
Safe area = x / y / width / height on the 800×480 stream:

| Variant | URL | Safe area | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `map-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | Map only, VW shows guidance natively |
| `card-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | with the iPhone's manoeuvre card |
| `url-map-hybrid` | `…/map?showSpeedLimit=yes` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | speed-limit parameter (no visible effect) |
| `map-clean-l40` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 160 / 108 / 400 / 296 | shifted 40 columns to the left |
| `map-square` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 240 / 60 / 320 / 340 | mathsls's MU1161 layout, closer to square, 30 fps (default until v1.2.0) |
| **`map-square-fps40`** | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 240 / 60 / 320 / 340 | **default (main button) since v1.3.0**: `map-square` at 40 fps (the base core's value, as mathsls), no more lag than 30 fps in a test drive; an IDR every 10 frames gave artefacts |

## Fail-closed gates (what must match before anything is written)

1. **Hashing self test** on the unit: the factory `/net/rcc/usr/bin/sha1sum`, run locally on MMX (where GEM scripts run), must
   compute the correct SHA-1 of `selftest.bin`. The manifest stays SHA-256; `build_sd.py` adds a SHA-256 → SHA-1 map (`HASHMAP`) to
   `pmcp.sh` for every manifest file and every factory file that is checked. No entry in the map means refusal.
   (SHA-256 in `gawk` was dropped: the "C" locale on QNX is multibyte, only `C-TRADITIONAL` worked, and it ran at about
   10–20 KB/s. With `sha1sum` actions take seconds.)
2. **Payload on the SD card:** hash and size of every file equal to the manifest embedded in `pmcp.sh`. The loop runs over the
   manifest inside the script itself (no temporary file), so a read-only card cannot skip the check.
3. **Firmware:** `lsd.jxe` = 55,830,309 bytes (MU1161).
4. **Unit state:**
   - `STOCK`: no `/mnt/app/carplaymaps`, no navigation/control JARs, `lsd.sh`, `dio_manager`, `gal`, iAP2 driver and `iap2.cfg` stock.
     `install` is allowed only in this state. A leftover `.carplaymaps-old-*` from an interrupted `restore` does not block it
     (`install` cleans it up).
   - `VIDEO` (stage A): wrapper active, stock `lsd.sh`, none of our JARs.
   - `JAVA` (stage B+): as `VIDEO`, plus the block in `lsd.sh` and a consistent JAR set (each with its manifest hash, `HMI_BOOT`
     matching exactly). A set may also hold packages of an earlier card (`JAVA_OLD`: v1.2/v1.3 `rg` `717fb53c` and `rglu`
     `72ab7221`, the experimental `rglua`, `rgluasf`, `rgluasfa`, `rgluasfm`, `rgluasfma`); then `java-on` and `java-off`
     refuse (`JAVA_SET_HAS_OLD_PACKAGES_RUN_JAVA_UPDATE_FIRST`) until `java-update` replaces them, and "Status" shows
     "packages of an earlier card: …".
   - Route guidance system (`RGSYS`, shown by "Status"): `off`, `on`, `old` (on, but with the driver and/or reader of an
     earlier card, `RG_KNOWN`: v1.0-v1.3 driver `76926bde…`, Tomasz's reader `b683cef7…`; `rg-update` replaces them) or `unknown`.
   - `PARTIAL`: an interrupted action or files of a version this card does not support, stock copies intact. Allowed:
     `restore`, `rg-system-off`, and the main-screen repairs of the part that is mixed: 2 / `map-install` (map files:
     `restore`, then install), 3 / `aa-install` (Android Auto files: `aa_off`, then install), 4 / `features-reset` (route
     guidance or Java files: back to the verified factory files, then 4 installs).
   - `UNKNOWN`: anything else, e.g. another mod or a modified `lsd.sh`. **Everything is refused.**
   - Android Auto (`AASYS`, since v1.5.0, shown by "Status"): `off`, `on` (this card's set), `old` (a whole set of an
     earlier experimental card, `AA_OLD`; main-screen button 3 / `aa-install` updates it in place) or `unknown` (a mix, an interrupted
     action or an experimental card's set it does not know: the unit state is then `PARTIAL`; `aa-install` removes it first, as
     `aa-remove` does, then installs this card's set). Button 4 never changes it (it stops with
     `FEATURES_NEED_ANDROID_AUTO_REPLACED_FIRST_PRESS_3` while it is `unknown`). `aa-remove` ("AA remove", also the first step of `restore`) writes only
     on a pmcp install and only when `gal` is factory or `carplaymaps/aa/gal.real` has the factory hash: the factory `gal`
     is staged from that copy, verified and moved in, then the AA files and markers go. Running it again finishes an
     interrupted run.
5. **Every staged copy** is hashed before the swap; `chmod` is checked, `dio_manager` must be executable. Right before the swap the
   installer checks again that `lsd.sh` and `dio_manager` are still stock.
6. **After the swap** the state must be the expected one and `core.so` must have the expected hash. Otherwise automatic rollback.
7. **Flush to disk:** `sync` on MMX (`on -f mmx sync`), because the files live there; an RCC `sync` is not needed.

Swap order:
- stage A: old trial markers removed → `carplaymaps` directory → `dio_manager`;
- `java-on`: JAR → `HMI_BOOT` (new id = new trial boot) → `lsd.sh` (only for the first package);
- `java-off`: `HMI_BOOT` → JAR removed; for the last package: stock `lsd.sh` first, then JAR and `HMI_BOOT`;
- `restore`: `lsd.sh` → `dio_manager` → JARs → route guidance system → trial markers → `carplaymaps` moved with one `mv` to
  `.carplaymaps-old-<pid>`, and only then `rm -rf`.
- route guidance system (`rg-system-on`): `/mnt/system` goes back to read-only after the write;
- `rg-update`: this card's driver and reader staged and hashed → reader stopped → driver `mv` → reader `mv`; only files
  listed in `RG_KNOWN` are replaced, `iap2.cfg`, `SYSTEM_ON` and the factory copies stay (way back: `rg-system-off`).
  Running it again after an interruption finishes the job;
- `java-update`: new JARs (a file name no earlier card used, e.g. `pmcp-guidance.jar`) → `HMI_BOOT` (new set id = new
  trial boot) → the old JARs removed. Until `HMI_BOOT` switches, the old set stays intact.

**Power-loss test** (`installer/test/fault_inject.sh`): for every action of the chain
install → java-on nai → java-on np → rg-system-on → java-on rg → switch → java-off np → java-off rg → rg-system-off → java-off nai → restore
the script is killed before the 1st, 2nd, 3rd … command that changes the unit. For each point: a simulated **next boot** (the
`lsd.sh` block from the killed tree) must not load, without a trial, a set the user has not confirmed; the state must be
STOCK/VIDEO/JAVA/PARTIAL, and `restore` (or install+restore from STOCK) must give the stock tree.

## Use in the car: GEM buttons

Requires: M.I.B. installed ([01-mib-install-backup.md](01-mib-install-backup.md)) and an **install card** built by
`installer/build_card_install.py`: a complete card = the untouched `MIB_V3.6.0.zip` tree (autorun disarmed, `_Swdlautorun.txt`) +
the SD build from `installer/build_sd.py` (`pmcp/`, `esd/Launcher-sda0.esd`), assembled with
`python3 -I installer/build_card_install.py <SD build> <card dir>` (every build file is checked against `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt`; it
refuses an armed autorun or rescue-card files). Hashes of all files: `PMCP_CARD_MANIFEST.txt`, instructions:
`PMCP_INSTRUKCJA.txt`. You copy **the whole content** of the directory to an empty card (FAT32) instead of adding `pmcp/` to an
M.I.B. card by hand.

How it works: in GEM the unit has a symlink `engdefs/z_Launcher-sda0.esd` → **the menu file on the card**
(`/net/mmx/fs/sda0/esd/Launcher-sda0.esd`, created by M.I.B. at install time). The `pmcp_stream_map_aid` screen is appended to that
file on the card. Nothing changes on the unit. The base file is exactly `esd/Launcher-sda0.esd` from `MIB_V3.6.0.zip`
(`22739f72…9121`); a test checks that the original content is untouched (only the end is appended).

1. On the computer: copy the whole content of the install card directory to an empty card (card root).
   Check the version in the header of the pmcp screen in GEM: it must match the first line of `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt`.
2. In the car: GEM → `=>M.I.B.<=` → **`pmcp_stream_map_aid`**. Main screen (English; stable versions only, and 2, 3 and 4
   each repair or update their own part and replace versions this card does not support):
   - "1. Check card and unit (read-only)" → `verify`;
   - "2. Install CarPlay: the map on the AID (also repairs or updates it)" → `map-install map-square-fps40`: on a stock
     unit `install` (stage A, `PMCP_INSTALL_OK`); on a pmcp install `switch map-square-fps40` if another layout is active
     (`PMCP_SWITCH_OK`), otherwise `PMCP_MAP_INSTALL_OK (already installed ...)`; with mixed map files `restore`
     (verified factory files) and then `install` (Android Auto and the features are gone with it: press 3 and/or 4 again);
     another mod's files: nothing is changed;
   - "3. Install Android Auto: Google Maps on the AID + VW arrows (needs 2)" → `aa-install` (`PMCP_AA_ON_OK mode=gamma`):
     an unsupported AA set is removed first (`aa_off`, only from a `gal.real` with the factory hash, otherwise it stops and
     changes nothing), an earlier experimental card's set it knows (`AA_OLD`) is updated in place; this card's set
     already there (also the one v1.5.0 installed) answers `PMCP_AA_INSTALL_OK (already installed: ..., nothing
     changed)`. If unsupported Android Auto files and unsupported route guidance / Java files are present at the same
     time, 3 stops with `AA_INSTALL_NEEDS_THE_FEATURES_REPAIRED_FIRST_PRESS_4_THEN_3`: 4 then resets the Java files and
     stops asking for 3; then 3, then 4 again;
   - "4. Install additional features: route guidance, zoom, day/night, song title, settings page (needs 2)" → menu script
     `features-on.sh`: `features-reset` (route guidance / Java files this card does not support, e.g. a set with an
     unknown package or after the rescue card, back to verified factory copies), `rg-update`, `java-update`,
     `rg-system-on`, then `java-on` nai, np, rg, zoom, dn, one after another (one set, one trial boot; not `sl`, and the
     map is not touched); stops at the first `PMCP_FAIL` (`PMCP_FAIL=FEATURES_STOPPED_AT_...`), `*_ALREADY_*` counts as
     done, so the same button brings any earlier install to this card's set (`PMCP_FEATURES_ON_OK`). It needs 2 and stops
     while Android Auto files of an unsupported version are present (press 3 first);
   - "5. Confirm: everything works (in the first start after 3 or 4)" → `confirm` (`PMCP_CONFIRM_OK`): one confirm for
     the Java set's trial boot and the Android Auto trial (the first AA connection in the start after `aa-install`); when
     only one is in its trial it confirms that one and says why the other is not (e.g. "connect the phone first, then 5
     again");
   - "6. Try again: the next start is a new trial" → `retry` (both trials, whichever is not confirmed);
   - "7. Status (read-only)", "8. Remove everything (back to factory files)" → `restore`;
   - sub-screen `pmcp_advanced` ("9. Advanced" on the screen) with three sub-screens:
     `features_advanced`: "0. Diagnostics (read-only, photograph the screen)" (works even when `pmcp.sh` stops at its
     self test), "Start timeline: …", "RG last maneuver: …" (what the iPhone sent and which VW arrow the strict mapping
     gives; where it shows main 0 the `rg` package may still show a fallback arrow), "Navigation diagnostics: …", "CP save
     log: copy this start's CarPlay log to the unit (for the log card)" (`cp-log-save`), "Delete saved logs, CarPlay and AA
     (after the log card copied them)", the four "Speed limit …" buttons, "Route guidance system on (iAP2 driver,
     iap2.cfg, reader)", "Route guidance system off (factory iAP2 driver and iap2.cfg)", "Route guidance system update
     (driver and reader of this card, RG stays on)" (`rg-update`), "Java update: packages of an earlier card -> this
     card's (rglu -> rg)" (`java-update`), and "On …" / "Off …" for each package (nai, np, rg, zoom, dn, and the optional
     `sl`, which only this screen installs);
     `carplay_advanced`: "Install map layout: <variant>" and "Switch map layout to: <variant>" (`switch`);
     `aa_advanced`: "AA Confirm: AA works (only in the start of the AA trial; 5 does the same)", "AA Try again: the next
     AA connection is a new trial", "AA status and stream analysis (read-only)", "AA save log: …", "AA delete saved logs,
     AA and CarPlay …", "AA remove (factory Android Auto back)". Experimental cards (not releases) add their experimental
     Android Auto software only on this screen.
   No action needs an unlock file (until v1.1.0 the Java and route guidance actions needed `pmcp/ODBLOKUJ_ETAP_B`).
3. The result is on the GEM screen. The SD card is read-only in GEM (even `mount -uw` fails), so the log cannot be written to the
   card: the installer prints `PMCP_WARN=SD_LOG_NOT_WRITABLE` and carries on. **Photograph the screen.** If the card is writable,
   the log goes to `/pmcp/log/pmcp-<action>-<pid>.log`.

All labels are in English (since v1.4) and plain ASCII.

Order (one visit to the car):
1. "1. Check card and unit" (`verify`): read-only. Expected `PMCP_VERIFY_OK state=STOCK`.
2. "2. Install CarPlay: the map on the AID" (stage A), then a full restart. If the AID shows no CarPlay picture: on the iPhone,
   Settings → General → CarPlay → the car → "Forget This Car", and reconnect (the iPhone remembers the car's old displays).
   For another map layout: `pmcp_advanced` → `carplay_advanced` → "Switch map layout to: …".
3. Only if the map works: "4. Install additional features" (and, optionally, "3. Install Android Auto") → restart (trial
   boot) → check the HMI and the features → **in the same boot** "5. Confirm" → restart. Without confirmation the next
   boot is stock.
4. Rollback: "8. Remove everything (back to factory files)" and restart.

Updating from v1.5.0, v1.4.x or v1.0-v1.3: "1. Check" (state `JAVA`; "7. Status" may show "Route guidance system: old"
and "packages of an earlier card: rglu"), then "2. Install CarPlay" (usually "already installed"), "3. Install Android
Auto" if Android Auto is used, "4. Install additional features" (runs `rg-update` and `java-update`); only if 3 or 4
installed something: restart (trial boot) → "5. Confirm" in that boot (from v1.5.0 all three usually answer "already
installed" / "nothing changed": no restart, no 5). Make a new rescue card too (see below).
The rescue card is for emergencies after Confirm; testing it first is optional.

Step-by-step guide for the car: [09-in-car-guide.md](09-in-car-guide.md).

## Host tests

`installer/test/run_tests.sh SD_BUILD mksh ksh` (with `PMCP_RESCUE_SD=<rescue card>`): the unit's file tree from the backup (real
`lsd.sh`, `dio_manager`, `jars`, iAP2 driver, `iap2.cfg`; `lsd.jxe` as a file of the right size), shells `mksh` (pdksh family, like
QNX) and `ksh` (ksh93). The exit status is the number of failed checks. They cover, among other things:

- `verify` writes nothing; a wrong variant, a corrupted payload byte (also with an unwritable log directory), a corrupted self test,
  a wrong `lsd.jxe` size, a modified `lsd.sh` and a foreign mod are refused with no change to the tree;
- the full chain install → Java packages (1, 2 and 5 at once) → route guidance system → switch → restore gives a tree **byte-identical** to stock;
- **trial boot on the real `lsd.sh` block** combined with `pmcp.sh`: trial → unconfirmed boot is stock → "5. Confirm" refused →
  retry → a boot in `swdl` mode loads nothing and deletes `last-boot` → confirmation only during the trial boot → a confirmed set
  always loads → `DISABLED` disables and blocks confirmation;
- the patched `lsd.sh` = stock + one block (checked with `diff`);
- leftovers (`.carplaymaps-new-*`, `.carplaymaps-old-*`, `*.pmcp-*`, old `ok.*` markers) are cleaned up by `install`; an
  interrupted `restore` (directory already moved) does not block the tool;
- rescue card: a healthy unit is unchanged; a `JAVA` unit → stock `lsd.sh`, JARs removed, `DISABLED`; a unit with the route
  guidance system → stock driver and `iap2.cfg`, `SYSTEM_ON` and `last-boot` removed; no backup copy or no `lsd.sh` → an honest
  `RESULT=UNSURE`;
- GEM menu: number of scripts = number of menu entries, syntax, allowed actions, main button = `map-square-fps40`, the version with build
  id identical in `pmcp.sh`, the menu and `BUILD-MANIFEST`.

`installer/test/fault_inject.sh SD_BUILD mksh`: the power-loss test (above).

What the host tests do not cover: QNX paths (`on -f mmx`, `mount`, `slay`, `/net/mmx` path translation) and the factory `sha1sum`
are skipped in test mode (the host computes SHA-1 with `shasum -a 1`); file permissions are not part of the `snapshot`; the
`Swdlautorun` → `stuff.sh` chain is tested on the script only. These parts were checked in the car.

## Rescue card (package 0)

A separate card (`installer/build_rescue.py`, instructions in `PMCP_RESCUE_README.txt` on the card). An armed `Swdlautorun.txt` →
the unit enters update mode by itself (`RUN_MODE=swdl`; our block loads nothing then) → M.I.B. 3.6.0 `stuff.sh` →
`pmcp-rescue/pmcp-rescue.sh`:
- stock `lsd.sh` from `/mnt/app/carplaymaps/rollback/`;
- our JARs removed;
- `/mnt/persist/pmcp/DISABLED`, `last-boot` removed;
- route guidance system: stock iAP2 driver and `iap2.cfg` from the backup copies (selected by size; our driver sizes known:
  743,196 B for v1.0-v1.3 and 743,272 B for v1.4), `SYSTEM_ON` removed.

The video (stage A) stays; "8. Remove everything" in GEM cleans up the rest afterwards. On a healthy unit without pmcp the script changes
nothing and only writes the log `PMCP_RESCUE_LOG.txt` (`=== PMCP RESCUE start ===` … `RESULT=OK` or `RESULT=UNSURE` …
`=== PMCP RESCUE end ===`). The M.I.B. autorun in P4512 update mode works without any HMI interaction (checked in the car).

Until v1.3 the card was in Polish (`pmcp-ratunek/`, `PMCP_RATUNEK_LOG.txt`, `WYNIK=OK` / `WYNIK=NIEPEWNY`); the copy helpers
read both log names. A rescue card made before v1.4 still works on a unit with the v1.3 driver, but it does **not**
restore the v1.4 driver (it only knows 743,196 B): after updating to v1.4, make a new rescue card (copy helper option 2).

After use M.I.B. disarms the card (`Swdlautorun.txt` → `_Swdlautorun.txt`) so it cannot loop. Re-arming is done on a
computer (copy helper option 3, or renaming the file by hand). Since v1.2.0 the installer no longer requires a rescue test
before the Java actions; it is recommended, not enforced.

## Safeguards for starting J9 with our JARs

Classes are version 46, references are checked against the unit's `java/*` classes (RefCheck), and every call from stock code is
guarded (tools in [`buildtools/`](../../buildtools/)). The scripts use the ksh constructs of the mathsls installer (backticks,
`while read`, heredoc, `case`, `read` with redirection). Fallback if something goes wrong: the trial boot with manual confirmation,
then the rescue card. Black screen during a trial boot (before "5. Confirm"): hold the volume knob for 10 s; the next boot runs without our JARs.
