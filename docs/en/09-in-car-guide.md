# In-car guide: step-by-step installation (Passat B8, MHI2 MU1161, AID 791)

Installer version: **`pmcp-0.2.0-mu1161-791-…`** (the suffix identifies the build; it is the first line of
`BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` and is shown in `PMCP_INSTRUKCJA.txt` on card 1 and at the top of the green menu screen).
The main screen of the green menu is in English. The submenu `pmcp_advanced` keeps the original Polish labels without
diacritics; each one is translated in parentheses below.

Everything is done in **one visit to the car**:

```
card 1:  1. Check  →  2. Install map  →  restart  →  map OK?  →  3. Install all features  →  restart (trial)
         →  test  →  4. Confirm (same start)  →  restart  →  works from now on
```

## Cards

| Card | Label | What it does | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 – install** | `INSTALL` | M.I.B. 3.6.0 + the installer, everything from the green menu, one action at a time | nothing starts by itself |
| **2 – rescue** | `RESCUE - DO NOT INSERT` | when inserted, the unit enters update mode **by itself** and undoes the Java changes | emergencies only; keep it out of the slot |

Both cards are made with the copy helper from the release zip (`README-FIRST.txt`). Always **only one card in the unit**,
always slot **SD1**.

## Rules for every step

- Power: battery charger/booster, or the engine running (outdoors). Ignition ON.
- **Do not interrupt** an action in the green menu (no "Back", do not pull the card) until the result is on the screen.
- Every action ends with a `PMCP_..._OK` line (good) or `PMCP_FAIL ...` (nothing was changed, or it was rolled back). On `FAIL`
  do not press anything else; take a photo of the screen.
- The SD card is read-only in the green menu, so the installer cannot write its log to the card (it prints
  `PMCP_WARN=SD_LOG_NOT_WRITABLE` and continues). **Photograph the result of every action.**
- Entering the green menu: hold **MENU for ~10 s** → `=>M.I.B.<=` → **`pmcp_CarPlay_AID`**. The header must show the version
  of your build (`pmcp-0.2.0-mu1161-791-…`); a different version = stop.
- "Restart" = **hold the volume knob for ~10 s** (the unit switches off and boots again). Switching the car off and on
  again right away is not a restart (the unit has not gone to sleep yet).

---

## Step 1. Check the card and the unit (read-only)

1. Insert **card 1**. Green menu → `=>M.I.B.<=` → `pmcp_CarPlay_AID`.
2. **"1. Check card and unit (read-only)"**. Takes a few seconds (hashes are computed by the unit's factory `sha1sum`).
3. Expected result: **`PMCP_VERIFY_OK state=STOCK`**. Nothing on the unit changes. On any other firmware the check stops here.

If anything is unclear, **"0. Diagnostyka (tylko odczyt, zrob zdjecia ekranu)"** (diagnostics, read-only, photograph the
screen; submenu `pmcp_advanced`) shows the unit's state and changes nothing.

## Step 2. Install the map (stage A)

1. **"2. Install the CarPlay map on the AID"** → expect `PMCP_INSTALL_OK stage=A variant=map-square ...`.
   (`map-square` is the default layout: the mathsls fork's layout, map only, closer to square; it was the best of five
   after a longer drive. After step 3 VW shows the manoeuvre, ETA and distance natively.)
2. Restart (knob ~10 s).
3. Connect the iPhone (CarPlay), open Apple Maps or Google Maps and **start guidance to a destination**. Switch the AID view to
   navigation/map. AID controls in this car (right side of the steering wheel): **view buttons** (cluster layout), **OK**
   between them, **up/down** next to them (cluster tabs/menu). The left side of the wheel is for driver assistance.
   Select the **Navigation** tab (up/down), then step through the layouts with the view buttons: the CarPlay map appears in
   the small centre dial and in the large full-width layout.
4. Check: CarPlay map on the AID, nothing running under the VW dials and bars.

**If the AID shows no picture:**
1. On the iPhone: Settings → General → CarPlay → this car → **"Forget This Car"**, reconnect.
2. Still nothing: green menu → **`pmcp_advanced` → `pmcp_zmien_wariant`** (change layout) → "Zmien wariant na: map-clean"
   (change layout to map-clean: wider and lower map window), restart.
3. Other layouts in the same submenu (each change → restart; layouts: [AID frame map](../aid-frame-map.html)):
   `card-clean` (with the iPhone's manoeuvre card), `url-map-hybrid` (map with the speed-limit parameter, which showed
   nothing in the car), `map-clean-l40` (map 40 columns to the left), `map-clean` (200 / 108 / 400 / 296).
   Back to the default: "Zmien wariant na: map-square".

Do not go on to step 3 without a map on the AID. Stage A does not touch how the head unit screen starts: the worst
outcome is no CarPlay picture, and the green menu with "Remove everything (back to factory files)" always works.

## Step 3. Install all features

**"3. Install all features: arrows, ETA, zoom, song title"** → expect **`PMCP_ALL_ON_OK`**.

It runs, one after another: the route guidance system (patched iAP2 driver, `iap2.cfg`, reader) and the five Java
packages (NavActiveIgnore, song title, guidance, zoom, day/night). They all land in **one set**, so there is one trial start
and one confirmation. It stops at the first failure (`PMCP_FAIL=ALL_ON_STOPPED_AT_...`; the steps before it stay done, the
screen says which). Pressing it again when everything is on changes nothing.

## Step 4. Trial start, test, confirm

Java changes how the head unit screen starts, so the new set goes through a **trial start**:

```
3. Install all features  →  restart  →  TRIAL START (the set loads once)
                                              │
                        everything works? ────┤
                            YES                │ NO / black screen
            in the SAME start, green menu:     │ knob ~10 s → next start is factory
            "4. Confirm: everything works"     │ (nothing confirmed, nothing to fix)
            → the set loads at every start     │
```

1. Restart (knob ~10 s). This start is the trial.
2. Check:
   - the unit starts normally (screen, radio, menus) and **CarPlay connects** (wired; plug/unplug once);
   - guidance in Apple Maps: the CarPlay map **stays** on the AID (NavActiveIgnore); time and distance to destination on the
     VW bar and in the left dial; the turn arrow and the distance to the manoeuvre (the arrow appears once the car moves).
     Google Maps and Waze: check whether they work too (it is not known whether they send this data);
   - CarPlay music (Spotify/Apple Music): title and artist in the AID media view;
   - map view on the AID: a **short** press of the up/down arrow on the wheel zooms in/out (holding does nothing);
   - day/night: after a start in daylight with the lights off (not AUTO) the AID map is light; with the lights on, dark.
3. Everything works → **"4. Confirm: everything works (only in the first start after 3)"** → `PMCP_JAVA_CONFIRM_OK`.
   Only in the trial start (the installer checks this): do not switch the car off between the restart and Confirm.
4. Something is wrong or the screen stays black → restart (knob ~10 s): the next start is factory. To try again:
   **"5. Try again: the next start is a new trial"**, restart. To find out which feature is the problem, enable them one at a
   time ([advanced](#advanced-one-feature-at-a-time)).

## Step 5. Restart

Restart once more. From now on the set loads at every start. **"Status (read-only)"** shows `state=JAVA`, the set and
`This boot: set=... use=yes`.

---

# Emergency: card 2 (rescue)

Only if, after Confirm, the screen stays black or keeps restarting and the knob does not help:

1. Insert **card 2** into SD1 and wait (up to ~60 s). The unit enters update mode by itself and may restart several times.
   On the question in the update menu → **Continue**. Do not pull the card while it updates.
2. When the unit is back on its normal screen → remove card 2. The Java part and the route guidance system are undone
   (factory `lsd.sh`, our JARs removed, `/mnt/persist/pmcp/DISABLED`, factory iAP2 driver and `iap2.cfg`); the map stays.
3. Card 1 → "Remove everything (back to factory files)" if you want the map gone as well.
4. M.I.B. disarms card 2 after use (`Swdlautorun.txt` → `_Swdlautorun.txt`), so it cannot loop. Re-arm it on a computer:
   copy helper, option **3** (it also shows the result: `PMCP_RATUNEK_LOG.txt`, `WYNIK=OK` = result OK, ending with
   `=== PMCP RATUNEK koniec ===`).

Optional: card 2 can be tested once on a working unit before step 1. On a unit without our files it changes nothing of
ours (M.I.B. 3.6.0 is installed again on the way). Re-arm it afterwards with option 3.

# Rollback and failures

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| No picture on the AID | iPhone: "Forget This Car", reconnect; then another layout (step 2) |
| Black screen / boot logo looping in the trial start | knob ~10 s; the next start is factory |
| A feature misbehaves | restart without Confirm (factory), then enable features one at a time ([advanced](#advanced-one-feature-at-a-time)) |
| CarPlay does not connect after step 3 | `pmcp_advanced` → `pmcp_etap_B_java` → "System RG: wylacz" (route guidance system off), restart |
| Black screen after Confirm | **card 2** (emergency above), then card 1 → "Remove everything (back to factory files)" |
| Roll back everything | "Remove everything (back to factory files)" → `PMCP_RESTORE_OK` → restart (factory unit) |
| Any `PMCP_FAIL` or anything unclear | do not press anything else, photograph the screen, "0. Diagnostyka" (read-only) |

The only allowed firmware update is the official K4525. Never cross-flash firmware from another model.

---

# Advanced: one feature at a time

Instead of step 3, the features can be enabled one by one in **`pmcp_advanced` → `pmcp_etap_B_java`**. Every "Wlacz"
(enable) makes a new set → restart → trial start → test → "4. Confirm". "Wylacz" (disable) goes back to the set without that
package: if that set was confirmed before, it loads straight away; if not, it is a trial too. After a restart "Status" shows
`This boot: set=... use=trial` (trial, Confirm needed) or `use=yes` (confirmed).

1. **"Wlacz: NavActiveIgnore (mapa na AID przy prowadzeniu w iPhonie)"** (map stays on the AID while the iPhone guides).
   Check: guidance in Apple Maps, the CarPlay map stays on the AID.
2. **"Wlacz: Tytul i wykonawca utworu CarPlay na AID"** (CarPlay song title and artist on the AID).
3. Route guidance, two parts:
   - **"System RG: wlacz (sterownik iAP2, iap2.cfg, czytnik)"** (route guidance system on: iAP2 driver, iap2.cfg, reader;
     not Java, no Confirm) → restart → check **only that CarPlay connects**. If not: **"System RG: wylacz (fabryczny sterownik
     i iap2.cfg)"** (off: factory driver and iap2.cfg), restart, and skip the next item.
   - **"Wlacz: Prowadzenie: strzalki, dystans, czas na AID (wymaga Systemu RG)"** (guidance: arrows, distance, time on the
     AID; needs the route guidance system).
4. **"Wlacz: Zoom mapy CarPlay strzalkami na kierownicy"** (map zoom with the steering-wheel arrows). Watch whether it gets
   in the way of the cluster menu (same arrows).
5. **"Wlacz: Dzien/noc mapy CarPlay na AID (ponowne wyslanie po starcie)"** (day/night for the AID map, resent after start).
   The key case (reported by another 791 owner, omonob #51): car outdoors in daylight, lights off (not AUTO) → start → the
   map must be light. Without this package the map stays dark until the lights are switched on.

## Cheat sheet

```
INSTALL:    card 1 → 1. Check (STOCK) → 2. Install map → restart → map on the AID?
            → 3. Install all features → restart (trial) → test → 4. Confirm → restart → done
FAILURE:    trial start broken → knob 10 s → factory start;   after Confirm broken → card 2 → Remove everything
RESCUE:     after using card 2: copy helper option 3 on a computer re-arms it
```
