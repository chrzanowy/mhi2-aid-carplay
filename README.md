# mhi2-aid-carplay

CarPlay map and native route guidance on the Active Info Display (AID, virtual cockpit) of a **VW Passat B8 (MY2018)**
with a **Discover Pro MHI2** head unit: **MU1161**, train `MHI2_ER_VWG13_P4512`, AID part 791.

![CarPlay map with native VW guidance on the AID](docs/img/aid-carplay-2026-10/IMG_1127.jpg)

> **Branch `experimental`:** this is the v1.4.1 release plus Android Auto on the AID (one mode, "gamma": Google Maps
> picture + VW arrows, package `rg-aa`). Not a release. Android Auto: [aa/README.md](aa/README.md), in the car:
> [docs/en/13-experimental-guide.md](docs/en/13-experimental-guide.md). Everything else below is the release's text.

This repository holds only what is specific to this head unit. It builds on the work of the projects listed under
[Credits](#credits). The general MHI2 CarPlay-on-cluster work lives there.

> **Warning.** This modifies the infotainment of a car. It has been run on exactly one car: MU1161 + AID 791, firmware
> P4512. Every installer step checks file hashes and stops on any mismatch, but you use this at your own risk. Never
> cross-flash firmware to make it fit. Not affiliated with Volkswagen, Harman or Apple.

## What works (tested in the car, October and November 2026)

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| CarPlay map video on the AID (Apple Maps, Google Maps), big and small dial layouts | works |
| NavActiveIgnore: the head unit no longer stops or blocks phone navigation | works |
| Native VW guidance from the iPhone: distance and time to destination on the VW bar and in the left dial | works |
| Native turn arrow and distance to the manoeuvre (appears once the car moves) | works |
| Arrow at the start of a route and at roundabout turns (fallback where the strict mapping gives none) | works |
| Distance bar before the manoeuvre (VW countdown bargraph) and the current street name | works |
| Native VW lane guidance, including U-turn lanes (when the phone app sends lanes) | works |
| Guidance feed survives a stuck iAP2 driver read (the reader restarts its worker instead of ending) | in the car since 2026-11-03; recovery tested on the host |
| Map zoom with the steering-wheel arrows | works |
| CarPlay track title and artist on the AID | works |
| Day/night switching of the cluster map | works |
| Speed limit from the phone (`showSpeedLimit=yes`) | shows nothing on this unit |
| Optional (v1.4.1, package `sl` by amjad-alarori): the car's own VW map speed limit in front of the street name, or a trial in CurrentPositionInfo | 50 → 70 km/h confirmed on an e-Golf (AID 795A); not yet tried on AID 791. [Details](docs/en/16-native-speed-limits.md) |

iAP2 route guidance carries no numeric speed limit (research by
[maxim-smirnov/mhi2-carplay-cluster](https://github.com/maxim-smirnov/mhi2-carplay-cluster) on iOS 26.6/27);
`showSpeedLimit=yes` only asks the phone to draw a sign into the video, and no sign was seen on this unit.

![Map without active navigation](docs/img/aid-carplay-2026-10/IMG_1102.jpg)

v1.4 in the car (2026-11-04), Apple Maps with native VW guidance: the street name in the top bar and in the right dial,
the turn arrow with the VW distance bar counting down to the maneuver, time and distance to the destination, and VW lane
guidance (second photo). The speed-limit sign at the top comes from the car itself (VW traffic sign recognition and
navigation data), not from the phone.

## Components

| Directory | What it builds | Lands on the unit |
|---|---|---|
| [`patches/mu1161/`](patches/mu1161/) | `core.so` variants of the CarPlay cluster stream (safe area, URL, frame rate, key frames, physical size) from one hash-pinned base | `core.so` |
| [`navactiveignore/`](navactiveignore/) | NavActiveIgnore built from the unit's own HMI classes | Java (HMI) |
| [`rg/`](rg/) | Native route guidance (one package `rg`): port of tomasz-twardzicki's MU1427 solution to MU1161 (iAP2 RouteGuidance → BAP) with his lanes, distance bar and street name, our U-turn lanes and maneuver fallbacks, our iAP2 log gate and reader | Java, iAP2 driver, `iap2.cfg`, reader |
| [`nowplaying/`](nowplaying/) | CarPlay track title and artist on the cluster | Java (HMI) |
| [`hmiextras/`](hmiextras/) | Steering-wheel zoom and day/night resend for the cluster map | Java (HMI) |
| [`speedlimit/`](speedlimit/) | Optional native VW map speed limit in the cluster's navigation text | Java (HMI), saved opt-in setting |
| [`installer/`](installer/) | SD-card installer run from the M.I.B. GEM menu, the rescue card, host tests | nothing by itself |
| [`buildtools/`](buildtools/) | Host checks: try/catch guard around every hook call, J9 CDC API check | nothing |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Read-only firmware readers (QNX6, IFS, LZOZ, JXE → JAR), SD-card tester | nothing |
| [`firmware/`](firmware/) | Hashes and notes for the official K4525 update (the only allowed firmware) | nothing |

### Map layout variants (GEM → `pmcp_advanced` → `pmcp_switch_layout`)

The stream is 800×480 and lies 1:1 on the AID panel. Safe area values are x / y / width / height.

| Variant | URL | Safe area | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `map-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | map only, VW shows guidance natively |
| `card-clean` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | with the iPhone's manoeuvre card |
| `url-map-hybrid` | `…/map?showSpeedLimit=yes` | 200 / 108 / 400 / 296 | speed-limit parameter (no effect seen) |
| `map-clean-l40` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 160 / 108 / 400 / 296 | 40 columns to the left |
| `map-square` | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 240 / 60 / 320 / 340 | mathsls's MU1161 layout, closer to square; best after a longer drive; 30 fps |
| `map-square-fps40` (default) | `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | 240 / 60 / 320 / 340 | `map-square` at 40 fps (as mathsls); no more lag than 30 fps in a test drive |

All variants declare a physical size of 240×144 mm. Switching a variant swaps one file (`core.so`) and needs a restart.

## Download and install

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrzanowy/mhi2-aid-carplay/releases/latest)**: the file
`mhi2-aid-carplay-cards-<build id>.zip`. It holds both SD cards ready to use. No programs to install, Windows or Mac.

1. Unpack the zip and open `README-FIRST.txt`. It walks you through everything in plain English.
2. Double-click `Copy-to-SD-Windows.bat` (Windows) or `Copy-to-SD-macOS.command` (Mac). It copies a card onto an
   **empty** FAT32 SD card, checks every file and ejects the card. It never formats a card or deletes anything.
   Make card 1 (install) and card 2 (rescue, for emergencies).
3. In the car, one visit, card 1 only (part 2 of `README-FIRST.txt`, details: [in-car guide](docs/en/09-in-car-guide.md)):
   **1. Check → 2. Install map → restart → map OK? → 3. Install all features → restart (trial start) → test →
   4. Confirm → restart.** It works like this from then on.
   Card 2 is only for an emergency after Confirm. After use it disarms itself; the copy helper's option 3 re-arms it.

**Updating from v1.0-v1.3:** card 1 of this release, "1. Check", then **3. Install all features or update** → restart
(trial start) → test → **4. Confirm**. Button 3 replaces the earlier driver, reader and Java packages (`rglu` → `rg`) by
this card's. Make a new card 2 as well: rescue cards made before v1.4 do not restore the v1.4 iAP2 driver.
Experimental Android Auto from the `experimental` branch is taken off by this card too: button 3 (and "Remove everything")
first puts the factory `gal` back from its hash-verified copy; the advanced menu has a separate "Remove experimental
Android Auto" button.

Before you start you need [M.I.B. installed on the unit and a backup](docs/en/01-mib-install-backup.md). The installer
on the card checks every file of your head unit first. On any other firmware it stops and changes nothing.

Check the download against `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release if you want to be sure it is complete.

## Build the cards yourself (advanced)

Instead of the ready-made cards, you can build them from your own unit's M.I.B. backup (macOS; Linux works for
building). The result is byte-identical to the release.

```sh
mkdir ~/mhi2-workspace && cd ~/mhi2-workspace
git clone https://github.com/chrzanowy/mhi2-aid-carplay.git
cd mhi2-aid-carplay
./install.sh                # or double-click Install-macOS.command in Finder
```

`install.sh` goes through 11 numbered steps. Each one says what it does and why, and shows every command it runs:
it checks your computer and your backup (train `MHI2_ER_VWG13_P4512` / MU1161, every file by SHA-256), downloads the
pinned sources, builds and tests everything (including power loss at every write step), builds the two card folders
and can write them to SD cards. On any mismatch it stops and says what to do. The full log is in
`logs/install-<date>.log`. `python3 -I release/make_release.py build dist` then packs the release zip.

## Installer

The installer runs from the GEM (engineering) menu of [M.I.B.](https://github.com/Mr-MIBonk/M.I.B._More-Incredible-Bash)
on an SD card. Design rules:

- **Fail-closed.** Every file on the unit and on the card is checked by exact hash and size before anything is
  written. Unknown state means no change.
- Files are staged, verified and swapped in, and the stock files are backed up first. "Restore factory files" is
  always available.
- **Java packages use a trial boot.** After "3. Install all features" (or "On ..." for one package) and a restart, the
  change must be confirmed ("4. Confirm") in the same boot. Otherwise the next boot is stock again.
- A separate **rescue card** (`installer/build_rescue.py`) autostarts in update mode and restores the stock HMI
  without needing GEM.
- Host tests (`installer/test/run_tests.sh`, `fault_inject.sh`) run the installer against a copy of the unit's file
  tree under `mksh` and `ksh`. They include power loss at every write step.

## Building

This repository (the source) ships **no binaries** and nothing from Volkswagen firmware. Every build reads its inputs from a
workspace next to this repository and checks each input by SHA-256:

```
workspace/
  mhi2-aid-carplay/        this repository
  upstream/                clones of the projects below, at the pinned commits
  backup/MU1161/           M.I.B. backup of your unit (or set PMCP_BACKUP)
  archives/                M.I.B. 3.6.0 GEM menu, converted lsd.jar of your unit
```

| Input | Source | Pinned |
|---|---|---|
| base `core.so` (MU1102/791 profile, sha256 `00b48a8f…`) | omonob payload as shipped in M.I.B. | commit `3a2526a3` |

| GEM menu (`Launcher-sda0.esd`) | M.I.B. 3.6.0 release zip | sha256 `4bfc6e72…` |
| HMI classes, iAP2 driver | your own unit (M.I.B. backup) | sha256 per file |
| host tools | ASM 9.7 (Java builds), pyelftools 0.31 in `upstream/tools/venv-elftools` (`rg/`), gawk 3.1.5 in `upstream/tools/` (tests) | ASM jars by sha256 |

Build order: `navactiveignore/`, `nowplaying/`, `hmiextras/`, `rg/` (`build.sh` in each; needs JDK 11+ and ASM 9.7 in
`$ASM_DIR`), then `patches/mu1161/build_core.py`, `installer/build_sd.py`, `installer/build_card_install.py` and
`installer/build_rescue.py`. Run Python with `python3 -I`. If any input differs from the pinned hash, the build stops.

## Experimental: Android Auto on the AID (work in progress)

Not part of any release yet. We are working on the same result for Android Auto: the Google Maps picture on the AID and
native VW arrows from Google Maps maneuvers, over the head unit's own MOST path (no extra adapter). Status as of
2026-11-04, tested in the car:

How it works:
- the factory Android Auto receiver `gal` is started by a small wrapper with a hook (based on MacsInSpace's
  [mib-cluster-map](https://github.com/MacsInSpace/mib-cluster-map), without SD-card paths);
- the hook offers the phone a second 800×480 "cluster" screen and hands its H.264 stream to our feeder;
- the feeder takes the MOST video channel and writes the frames into the same ring and `altscreen-most-bridge` that
  CarPlay uses;
- every new Android Auto set runs once as a trial and stays only after a confirm in GEM, like the Java packages.

What works:
- the Google Maps picture on the AID (a 26-minute drive without problems in mode "AA 2");
- switching from CarPlay to Android Auto without a restart (the feeder now reuses CarPlay's video ring in place;
  `dio_manager` keeps that ring mapped, so deleting it had filled `/ramdisk`);
- native VW arrows with distance from Google Maps maneuvers ("gamma"). The hook translates the Android Auto navigation
  messages into the same mailbox format the CarPlay reader writes, and the same Java code shows them. In a test drive it
  recognised 94 of 94 maneuvers.

What does not work yet:
- **lost picture:** in about half of the connections the picture starts dark with artefacts, and the AID can also lose
  the picture during a drive (loading screen). Same cause: the phone sends only one key frame per session.
  - Already tried without success: waiting 5 or 10 s after taking the MOST channel, and holding and repeating that key
    frame.
  - Next: the feeder paces the frames into the bridge (about 2 Mbit/s) and logs gaps in the stream (built and tested on
    the computer, not yet in the car); a different `idr_pic_id` in repeated key frames stays an idea. The head unit's own
    video software is not touched.
  - Workaround: plug the phone in again.
- no VW arrow at the very start of a route with Android Auto (its "depart" step is not mapped yet).

What we learned:
- re-sending the video configuration to the phone drops the Android Auto connection about 9 s later;
- a focus cycle on the head unit breaks the phone's session (it drops to about 3 fps and resets the connection about
  two minutes later);
- full Google Maps navigation messages need Android Auto protocol 1.7;
- destination distance and arrival time are left to the Android Auto picture, which shows them already.

The v1.4 release card can always take this experimental Android Auto off again ("Remove experimental Android Auto";
button 3 and "Remove everything" do it first): it puts the factory `gal` back only from a copy with the factory hash.

- **[omonob/MHI2-Carplay-Maps](https://github.com/omonob/MHI2-Carplay-Maps)**: the original CarPlay map on the MHI2
  virtual cockpit. Its `core.so` (MU1102/791 profile) is the base that every variant here patches.
- **[Mr-MIBonk/M.I.B.](https://github.com/Mr-MIBonk/M.I.B._More-Incredible-Bash)**: the GEM toolbox the installer runs
  from, the unit backup, and the distribution of the omonob payload.
- **[tomasz-twardzicki/MHI2-Carplay-Maps](https://github.com/tomasz-twardzicki/MHI2-Carplay-Maps)**: the `core.so` patch
  sites (frame rate, key frames, URL, safe area), NavActiveIgnore classes, and the native route guidance solution
  (driver patch chain, HMI bridge, RGI reader) that `rg/` ports to MU1161: MU1427 v1.2.0 (arrows, distance, ETA, the
  strict maneuver mapping `LiveModel.map`), MU1367 v1.4.0 lane guidance, and MU1367 v1.4.3 distance bar, street name and
  feed recovery.
- **[mathsls/MHI2-Carplay-Maps](https://github.com/mathsls/MHI2-Carplay-Maps)**: the first MU1161 + AID 791 build. The
  physical-size sites and the layout used by `map-square` come from it.
- **[ZzYunOvO/MHI2-Carplay-Maps](https://github.com/ZzYunOvO/MHI2-Carplay-Maps)**: the toolbox that the mathsls and
  tomasz-twardzicki forks build on.
- **diasdio** and **ramasauskas**: key-frame and safe-area height fixes, the AUSAFE queue fix in the MOST bridge.
- **harman-f**: cluster URL query parameters (`showETA`, `maneuverLayout`, `showSpeedLimit`), and the iAP2 → VW BAP
  maneuver table of [mhi2_altscreen_carplay](https://github.com/harman-f/mhi2_altscreen_carplay)
  (`MibrRgiManeuvers.java`, commit `c01bbdc`, GPL-3.0) used by the arrow fallbacks in `rg/`.
- **[luka-dev](https://github.com/luka-dev/jxe2jar)**: jxe2jar, the RGI decoder and the iAP2 maneuver type names.
- **[amjad-alarori](https://github.com/amjad-alarori)**: the optional native VW speed-limit package `speedlimit/` (PR #3):
  the `DSITrafficRegulation` hook, the limit filter and its installer actions and tests.
- **maxim-smirnov**: documentation of the LZOZ container format, and the research showing that iAP2 route guidance
  carries no speed limit ([mhi2-carplay-cluster](https://github.com/maxim-smirnov/mhi2-carplay-cluster)).
- **MacsInSpace**: the "Forget this car" tip when the cluster gets no picture.
- The **MQB Toolbox** community: the original NavActiveIgnore idea.
